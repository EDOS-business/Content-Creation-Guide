# Media Production Basics, a guide for the perplexed

I hope it is obvious to everyone that video-first content has become the rule of the day in the attention economy of the internet, therefore this is an introduction to making video content for the web, specifically for edos.io, but, for the most part, applicable generally.

## Preamble Tips and Ethics

The captured audio quality must be at least good, video quality is secondary. If the audio is bad; riddled sibilance and digital artifacts, too quiet, too loud, or just annoying to listen to, people will bail out, and it may do more harm than good. If the audio quality is excellent, even minimally acceptable video will seem better than it is. 

#### Cadence is important

A piece of content per week is not enough, everyone participating should shoot for at least 3 pieces of content per week. Two short pieces and one longer, more in-depth post should work. Jab, jab, hook. Repeat, until we learn to throw more complex combinations as our metaphorical boxing skills improve.

#### Excitement sells 

keeping your energy up while speaking may be difficult, especially at first, I may try standing to keep my internal fire burning while delivering the words, standing energe is strong energy.

#### Stay focused

write a script if necessary, you will more than likely find that it is, until your performance skills begin to flow. Make no mistake, these are performances.

#### Limit your discussions

to one of perhaps two different areas of personal expertise, within a given piece of content. Present your ideas clearly and directly, aim for a natural, conversational tone, except where precise technical explanations are necessary. 

#### On Swimming

If you're like me, you'll be uncomfortable at first. Just keep swimming and you'll get better at...you know, swimming.

#### Start by doing THREE TAKES

Unless one of the first two were clearly absolute champion runs, just publish the third take by default. This is a good practice until you find the capturing cadence that works best for you, as your workflow matures.

## Stage One Content Creation: The Camcorder

### Materials

One will need a few basic materials to get started.

1. Make sure you can log into the YouTube, Instagram, Twitch, X, LinkedIn or other service accounts you intend to post content on.
2. Have a smartphone with a reasonably good camera and microphone.
3. A setting that is visually appealing, whether a nicely decorated background in a home office, or a park or outdoor setting, make sure the setting is visually appealing in some fashion.
4. A setting that is friendly to capturing accessible audio. Loud environments with too much noise will not produce adequate quality audio in many cases.

### Process

The process can be as easy as pressing "record" on the default video camera application on your device, looking into the camera and speaking. Something is usually better than nothing. If the thoughts contained in the clip are of any value, and assuming there is nothing offensive unintentionally captured in the video, and the audio quality is decent, ship it!

## Stage Two Content Creation:  n00b Home Studio

### Materials

Additional materials for more flexibility and options when creating video content. In addition to the Stage One Materials above, I highly recommend obtaining and setting up the following:

1. An External Microphone. The best value microphone for this sort of use is still probably the Shure SM7B, but one does not need anything that fancy to vastly improve audio quality. I have several professional XLR microphones but choose to use the old Blue Yeti USB mic I have, because it is fine for voice recording, when set up properly. Your mileage may vary, but using an external mic is almost guaranteed to improve the quality of your output. (The mics on modern smartphones are actually pretty good, but positioning is also important, laptop microphones still tend to pass along a lot of noise in the signal, as do airpods, based on my recent tests)
2. A tripod to mount your best camera. You'll likely find that your smartphone is the best video camera you own, unless you're an Audio/Video type of nerd, in which case, do you have any tips for me?
3. Good lighting, covered in more detail under "Process" below
4. Multiple Monitors, this will come in very handy for monitoring your output.

### Process

This is where we begin to set up a content creation studio. 

1. Microphone placement and level setting should be first. In OBS there are audio level meters, just keep the peak levels out of the red and averaging toward the upper end of the green section while speaking and you should be good to go.
2. Then focus on positioning the camera or cameras in a suitable location for capturing your subject (probably you) while being able to operate the computer. This may be tricky at first, and may require rearranging the furniture, getting a different (smaller or bigger) tripod and other adaptation to get right. Place your camera slightly above your subject, especially if that subject is your face, looking down into the camera is not a good vibe for media content. Make sure the background is aesthetically pleasing and the shot does not include unwanted elements. Make sure your face/subject is in focus, take some test runs.
3. Lighting; good diffused (soft) lighting is often difficult. You may have adequate natural lighting, or be very fortunate to have good light fixtures for this task in your home office, but you'll probably find that you will eventually need to purchase lights for this purpose, and place them above and in front of your subject area to get good results. There are many good videos on how to set up semi-professional lighting for conference calls and video podcasts, of which this is but one. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1OCC5UN0to
4. Maybe you don't want your face on camera, which is understandable to many people, and that's when I would recommend creating a computer display video-capture and doing on screen demos, and/or editing together a series of screenshots and other still images, most of which may be facilitated through native means, to some degree, but are better served by third-party video capturing/editing software like DaVinci Resolve, or a tool like OBS, covered below.

## Stage Three Content Creation: The Home Studio Streamer

When and/or if you are ready to take it to the next level, check out the following tools.
### Materials

1. OBS (Open Broadcaster Studio) is free and feature rich, but there is a learning curve, to be covered in follow-up documentation 
2. A Green Screen background, or other Chroma Key friendly background screen material.
	1. Getting this set up is covered here, ignore the marketing pitch for their screens, anything you can light well can get reasonably flat behind you will work great.
	2. Go big, smaller screens will be disappointing after your first run or two, make sure you give yourself room to work.
3. DaVinci Resolve is free video-editing software with a startling number of features and extensive documentation, this is an advanced move and nobody is expecting anyone to learn this right away, if at all. 

### Process

The process will vary as you learn what you want to do with these tools, both of them are fairly intuitive, but the number of options will make it daunting at first. A huge number of tutorials exist for both applications, and the .pdf reference for DaVinci Resolve is over 4,000 nicely-formatted pages. I 

I found the following videos to be useful to get me started quickly:
